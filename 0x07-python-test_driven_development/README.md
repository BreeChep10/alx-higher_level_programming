#                                          Python Test-Driven Development (TDD) with doctest and unittest

##                                                           Introduction

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. Python provides two powerful testing libraries, doctest and unittest, to facilitate the TDD process.

This README guide will walk you through the concepts and usage of both doctest and unittest for TDD in Python.

How doctest Works

doctest is a built-in Python module that searches for docstrings in your code and runs any test examples found in those docstrings. It's a simple and convenient way to include tests directly within your code's documentation.
Writing doctests

To write doctests, you need to include examples in the docstrings of your functions and classes. Here's an example:

python

```
def add(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers together.

    Examples:
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(0, 0)
    0
    """
    return a + b
```


In this example, we have defined the add function and included two test examples in the docstring. Each example consists of an input expression and the expected output.
Running doctests

You can run doctest by executing the following command:

bash

python -m doctest your_module.py

Replace your_module.py with the name of the Python file containing your doctests. doctest will automatically discover and execute the tests within your docstrings.
unittest
Creating Test Cases

unittest is another Python library for writing and running tests. It provides more advanced testing capabilities compared to doctest and is suitable for larger projects with complex test scenarios.

To use unittest, you need to create test cases by subclassing unittest.TestCase. Here's an example:

python
```
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        result = add(2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_add_zero(self):
        result = add(0, 0)
        self.assertEqual(result, 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
In this example, we define a test case TestAddFunction that includes two test methods (test_add_positive_numbers and test_add_zero). Each test method uses self.assertEqual to check if the function add behaves as expected.
Running unittests

To run unittest tests, execute your test script using Python:

bash

python your_test_script.py

Replace your_test_script.py with the name of the Python script containing your unittests. unittest will discover and execute all the test methods within your test case classes.
Best Practices

>    Write tests before writing code to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
>    Use descriptive test method names for clarity.
>    Organize your test cases into separate test case classes.
>    Run tests regularly during development to catch issues early.
>    Maintain a consistent directory structure for your test files.

Conclusion

Python's built-in testing libraries, doctest and unittest, provide powerful tools for implementing Test-Driven Development. Whether you prefer simple inline tests with doctest or more complex test suites with unittest, TDD helps you write reliable and maintainable code by design.

Happy testing and coding!
